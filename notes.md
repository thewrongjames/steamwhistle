# Notes

## Delete

Based on [this](https://edstem.org/au/courses/9408/discussion/973982) Ed post it seems like we can
change the text of the item delete message from the strange "have you already purchased this item"
message.

Based on [this](https://edstem.org/au/courses/9408/discussion/973982) Ed post it seems like I don't
actually need to distinguish the delete functionality between a purchased and not-purchased.

Between these, it looks like I can actually just make the action be a normal delete action.

## Dates

[This](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/jf14-date-time.html) is what I want
when working with dates. Looks like there are lots of bad options.
